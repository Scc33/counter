# Development Workflow

## Available Scripts

From [package.json](mdc:package.json):
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Development Best Practices

- Use Turbopack for faster development builds
- Run linting before committing changes
- Test the application in both light and dark modes
- Verify countdown functionality with various date inputs
- Test URL sharing functionality

## Code Quality

- Follow ESLint configuration in [eslint.config.mjs](mdc:eslint.config.mjs)
- Use TypeScript strict mode as configured in [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json)
- Maintain consistent code formatting
- Write meaningful commit messages

## Testing Considerations

- Test countdown accuracy across different timezones
- Verify responsive design on various screen sizes
- Test accessibility with screen readers
- Validate SEO metadata and social sharing
- Test URL parameter handling and edge cases

## Deployment

- Build the application before deployment
- Verify all static assets are properly optimized
- Test the production build locally before deploying
- Ensure proper environment variables are set
